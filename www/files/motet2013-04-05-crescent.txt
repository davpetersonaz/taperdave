location: placed the Zoom onstage, vocals are a bit faint
taper: davpeterson
note: i was retarded and accidentally paused the zoom in the 2nd song, only about a second was missed.
note: there are 2 glitches in track14 that sounds like the deck was paused for a second or so, not really sure what happened.
