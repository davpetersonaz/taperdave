location: the Zoom was placed onstage, most of the sampling wasn't in the monitors, so this sounds like a "stripped-down" Lotus show.
note: missed the first few seconds of Blacklight.
note: there were some problems with Jesse's electronics, his bass was full-on, though.
note: some idiot was playing "hand drums" with the stage right behind my zoom, i asked him to stop, but it is kinda annoying during t02-t05.
