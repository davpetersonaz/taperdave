source: SBD + ZoomH4n internal mics > sd card > Audacity > flac > you
taper: davpeterson
editing: soundguy messes with their levels throughout the show, he also nixed the right channel at the begining, so i had to copy the left channel into the right channel, then amplified AUD +5 and SBD +3, and phase adjusted by 3 frames before dithering the 2 sources..
