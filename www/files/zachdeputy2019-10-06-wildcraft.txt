source: Audio-Technica AT853 cardioid condensor mics > 10' flexed mini-xlr extension cable > 4.7k modified mini-xlr-to-headphone y-cable > ZoomH5 Handy Recorder plugin-power jack > Toshiba Exceria Pro 270-mb/s 32gb SD-HC-II card > audacity > you
location: compressed micstand atop the counter on the left side of stage, 8' from the left speaker and aimed directly at it.
taper: davpeterson
taper notes: i did not include the first set as there were so many issues... My mic's were located by the SBD, but the show was sparsely attended and everyone used the SBD area for phone calls and discussions, plus the bass was overpowering at that spot, and Zach was breaking in a new rig causing the p.a. to pop and crackle for the first 15 minutes, and he continued having issues so he called a setbreak to address them. At that point i moved the mics to the left side right up front directly in front of the speakers, which sounded GREAT, unfortunately my batteries died after the midway point of the 2nd set.
