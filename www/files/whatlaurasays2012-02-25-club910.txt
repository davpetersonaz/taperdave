taper: davpeterson
source: zoomH4n internal mics, placed 40-ft back in sbd area, the p.a. was very loud.

editing: amplified it by 5 (audacity).
notes: there are points in time it gets pretty "chatty" in front of the Zoom.
quality: came out kinda hollow and bassy, the place has a pretty powerful sound system.
