source: ZoomH5 internal mics > sd card > audacity > you
location: 7' mic stand placed in front of the soundboard, rather close to the Harp.
taper: davpeterson
notes: the mics were picking up the sound from the harp-stage which was right next to me, however the mics were pointed at the stage where the amplification came from, so you can notice some 'phasing'.
