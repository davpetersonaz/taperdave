# Steely Dan covers.

an early show, they played from 7:15 til 8:45, there ended up being a decent crowd by the end, but the show was short and not much liquor flowed, so there are patches of silence here and there, they failed to play 2 songs from their setlist: Daddy D and Kid Charlemagne, no encore.
