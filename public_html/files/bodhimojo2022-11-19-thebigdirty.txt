location: 5' micstand on top of the only available ledge in the place, which happens to face the stage almost dead center, less than 30' away.
taper: davpeterson
taper notes: at about 1:09 of track03 (and 1:25 of track04), i discovered if my deck was laid down a certain way, it would peak all the levels instantly, So i lost a couple seconds as i recovered and reset the levels, and then it happened again at the beginning of the next track.
