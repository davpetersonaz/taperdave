source: SBD + ZoomH4N internal mics
taper: davpeterson
location: Zoom was placed in the back of the room by the soundboard
taper notes: i didn't get plugged in to the soundboard for about an hour, so the first hour was AUD recording from all the way in the back of the room by the soundboard.  it was really chatty and distant, so i cut that out and just preserved the MATRIX portion of the evening.
