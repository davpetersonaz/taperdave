taper note: i used my Zoom-H4N's internal microphones, so it is a little chatty, but i saw no tapers there so i thought i'd at least capture it with the zoom.
unfortunately the batteries ran out before the show was over, so i only caught the first half of the second set.
they had their own soundboard person, so i was unable to patch in to the soundboard.
the show came out quite good and is very listenable.  enjoy!
